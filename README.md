# cryptoprice-discordbot

This discord bot follows the SOL/USD price using the Pyth Oracle (https://pyth.network/), but can be changed to any cryptocurrency available on the Pyth Network. To change to different crypto, simply change the account_key in the pyth.py file to a different price feed ID (https://pyth.network/developers/price-feed-ids#solana-mainnet-beta)
